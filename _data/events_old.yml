      IS-GEO and iHARP are pleased to announce a virtual workshop on Model-based Reasoning <a href="">https://is-geo.github.io/ISGEO-22/</a>. Invited expert, Dr. Deana Pennington from the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) brings prior expertise in evaluating social learning and model-based reasoning together with clear guidance for successful transdisciplinary team building. This workshop will provide methods that engage researchers across disciplines to explore how data and models can inform AI. Hands-on activities will support the development of conceptual models and participatory modeling implementation using data across applications in polar regions, hydrologic models, hazards planning, and climate change impacts on communities, as well as other topics salient to workshop participants.

      experience : Intelligent Systems Research to Support Geosciences and the EarthCube Mission
    description: >
      The goal of the workshop was to formulate a research agenda for intelligent systems that will result in fundamental new capabilities for understanding the Earth system. In geosciences, the workshop covered requirements from Earth, ocean, polar, and atmospheric and spatial sciences. In intelligent systems, the workshop included participation from fields such as information integration, machine learning, knowledge representation, semantics and metadata, geospatial computing, robotics, visualization, and augmented reality. The workshop builds on the momentum of the NSF EarthCube initiative for geosciences and was informed by ongoing cyberinfrastructure efforts.
