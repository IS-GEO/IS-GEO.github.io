    OntoSoft is a platform to provide a community repository for geosciences software. Key features of OntoSoft are:
    Allowing contributors to specify structured metadata about software, including input requirements, physical variables and assumptions, and software runtime dependencies. OntoSoft uses this structured metadata to improve search, to facilitate software reuse, and to support software integration.
    Assisting geoscientists to make their software more reusable. OntoSoft includes mini-tutorials to introduce geoscientists to topics such as licenses, software libraries, and software reuse.
    Maintaining compatibility with existing software catalogues , such as software repositories (e.g., GitHub) and model frameworks (e.g., CSDMS, CIG). OntoSoft includes links to software repositories, and import/export capabilities for model frameworks.
